# PICABORD Website Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from modern tech companies like Linear, Notion, and Vercel for clean, minimalist aesthetics with sophisticated visual treatments.

## Core Design Elements

**Aurora Borealis Theme:**
- Primary Deep Blue: 240 85% 15% (dark navy base)

- Soft Purple: 280 60% 65% (mystical purple)
- Light Background: 220 15% 97% (near-white with blue tint)
- Dark Text: 240 25% 20% (readable dark blue-gray)

**Gradient Applications:**
- Hero section backgrounds with subtle blue-to-purple transitions
- Section dividers with green-to-blue horizontal gradients
- Button hover states with aurora-inspired color shifts
- Card overlays with soft purple-to-transparent effects

### B. Typography
**Font Selection:** Inter or Poppins from Google Fonts
- Headings: 600-700 weight, generous letter spacing
- Body text: 400-500 weight, optimized line height (1.6)
- Navigation: 500 weight, slightly condensed
- Hero title: Large scale (3-4rem) with dramatic hierarchy

### C. Layout System
**Tailwind Spacing Units:** 4, 8, 16, 24 (p-4, m-8, gap-16, py-24)
- Generous whitespace between sections (py-24)
- Consistent component spacing (gap-8, p-16)
- Tight element groupings (gap-4)

### D. Component Library

**Navigation:**
- Clean horizontal navigation with smooth underline hover effects
- Aurora gradient accent on active tab
- Mobile hamburger with slide-out overlay

**Hero Section:**
- Full-viewport height with centered content
- Large product image with subtle parallax effect
- Gradient overlay for text readability
- Call-to-action buttons with aurora-themed backgrounds

**Content Sections:**
- Card-based layouts with subtle shadows
- Smooth fade-in animations on scroll
- Aurora gradient borders and dividers
- Minimalist product showcases

**Interactive Elements:**
- Buttons with gradient backgrounds and soft shadows
- Hover effects with color transitions
- Smooth scrolling between sections
- Lightweight fade and slide animations

### E. Animations
**Minimal and Purposeful:**
- Fade-in on scroll for content sections
- Smooth color transitions on hover
- Gentle parallax effect in hero
- Subtle loading animations for content

## Images Section

**Hero Image:** Large, high-quality product shot of PIKA1 device positioned prominently in the hero section. Should be professionally lit with clean background to complement aurora theme.

**Product Showcases:** Clean product photography for each division (TEC, ArcLight, Deeptech, AnnotiQ) with consistent lighting and minimal backgrounds.

**Company Images:** Team photos or office imagery with modern, tech-focused aesthetic for About Us section.

**Background Elements:** Abstract aurora-inspired graphics or subtle geometric patterns as section backgrounds - keep minimal to maintain focus on content.

## Key Design Principles
1. **Minimalism First:** Every element must serve a purpose
2. **Aurora Integration:** Color scheme should feel cohesive throughout
3. **Smooth Interactions:** All animations should be subtle and enhance UX
4. **Content Hierarchy:** Clear visual progression from hero to detailed sections
5. **Mobile Excellence:** Design mobile-first with graceful desktop scaling
